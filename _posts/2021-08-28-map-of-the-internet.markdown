This is the first blog post on my personal site and with it I wanted to explain some of the background behind the project aptly named "A Map of the Internet". This project was created for my bachelor level dissertation and aims to visualise the Internet itself using Aoutonomous System (i.e. network) level data from the BGP routing tables that is freely available thanks to the countless collectors deployed by various organizations across the world. It was only possible because of the relative openness of the structures that make up the internet and their cooperative nature
The [resulting visualisation](/map-of-internet/) contains individual networks as nodes and the connections between them as edges projected using several different projection methods and coordinate systems.
