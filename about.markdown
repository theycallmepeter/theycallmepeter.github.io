            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student currently finishing my Masters degree with focus on Data Science. That might have also given away that my main interests lie in working with and exploring the uses of the vast amounts of data thatare available in todays age of the internet. Pretty much every single one of my projects and work has been built around exploring the hidden potential in both data that is publicly available or even data that is collected, but not really being used. Naturally that also means I am very interested in the fields of AI and ML in all kinds of applications like natural language processing, reinforcement learning, image manipulation and many more...

                I will be graduating with an MSc in July 2022 and with that I will also be looking for a new place to start my career.
